# Description of packages:
    > commands: contains all the commands that do all the tasks throughout
    the simulation.
    > databases: contains the databases for children, gifts and a database that
    manage children, gifts and changes and is used to create the other two
    databases.
    > entities: contains the entities used in the program and 2 factories to
    create children and gifts from the input information classes.
    > fileio: contains the classes used to store the initial information from
    the input JSONs and the classes for writing the output in the result JSONs.
    > strategies: contains the strategies used for computing the nicescore for
    all the children categories and a factory to create the strategy needed.

# The simulation flow
    - The simulation class is the one that coordinates all the flow of the
    program, as it applies the changes of every year.
    - the first thing that needs to be done is populate the databases.
    - now we have the information for the first year of the simulation and we
    can start applying the commands and strategies:
        - delete the young adults, because they will not receive gifts;
        - calculate the nice scores for all the remaining children;
        - calculate the budget for every child;
        - decide which gifts every child receive and give them.
    - then the output object is created.
    - output will contain a list of children databases, every element being a
    version of the children database from the correspondent year (every year a
    deep copy of the children database is added at the list contained in the
    output class).
    - then for each round of the simulation, the new budget is set, the new
    gifts and new children are added to the correct database and the children
    database in updated in order to add it changed to the output at the end
    of the round.
    - the update consists in:
        - increasing the age of all the children and checking if any of them
        became young adult (if so, remove them from the database);
        - for every child mentioned in the update list, changing the attributes
        (add the nicescore, add the new preferences);
        - then the applying of strategies and commands is repeated as in the
        initial stage.
    - after all the rounds, the output is written to the out JSON.
